# Comprehensive Changelog: Payment Service Enhancements

This document provides a detailed summary of all the critical improvements, security fixes, and refactoring applied to the payment service during our entire session. 

---

## üèõÔ∏è I. Database Schema & Data Integrity (`database/schema.sql`)

This was a major overhaul to improve security, data integrity, and efficiency at the database level.

### 1. **ENUM Types for Status Columns**
*   **Change:** Converted all `VARCHAR` columns used for status or severity into strongly-typed PostgreSQL `ENUM` types.
*   **Affected Columns:** `payment_order_status`, `transaction_status`, `refund_status`, `dispute_status`, `invoice_status`, `severity_level`, and more.
*   **Impact:** Enforces strict data integrity at the database level, preventing invalid or arbitrary string values.

### 2. **Hardened Row Level Security (RLS) Policies**
*   **Change:** Added `WITH CHECK` clauses to all RLS policies on user-sensitive tables (`payment_orders`, `payment_transactions`, etc.).
*   **Impact:** Prevents users from inserting or updating rows with a `user_id` other than their own, closing a critical security loophole.
*   **Deny-by-Default:** Added a specific `DENY` policy to the `webhook_events` table to prevent any accidental data leakage.

### 3. **Secure Trigger Function**
*   **Change:** The `update_updated_at_column` trigger function was modified to be `SECURITY DEFINER`.
*   **Impact:** Ensures that the `updated_at` timestamp is reliably updated even when called by users with restricted permissions under RLS.

### 4. **Financial Data Protection**
*   **Change:** Added `CHECK (amount >= 0)` constraints to all monetary columns (`amount`, `fee`, `tax`, etc.).
*   **Impact:** Prevents negative values in financial columns, safeguarding data integrity.

### 5. **Optimized Indexes**
*   **Change:** Removed redundant indexes on columns that already had a `UNIQUE` constraint (e.g., `razorpay_order_id`).
*   **Impact:** Reduces database storage and improves write performance and maintenance efficiency.

## üì¶ II. Dependency Management (`package.json`)

### 1. **Removed Insecure `crypto` Package**
*   **Change:** Removed the deprecated `crypto` package from `dependencies`.
*   **Impact:** Eliminated a security risk and prevented conflicts with Node.js's built-in `node:crypto` module.

### 2. **Added Missing `eslint` Dev Dependency**
*   **Change:** Added `eslint` to `devDependencies`.
*   **Impact:** Fixed the `lint` script, ensuring consistent code quality checks for all developers.

---

## üîê III. Application Security & Authorization

### 1. **Hardened Cryptography Usage (`src/controllers/paymentController.js`)**
*   **Change:** Updated the crypto import to `import crypto from 'node:crypto';`.
*   **Impact:** Guarantees the use of the secure, built-in Node.js crypto library.

### 2. **Implemented User Ownership Authorization (Critical Fix)**
*   **New File:** Created `src/middleware/authMiddleware.js` to house the `validateOwnership` function.
*   **Route Change (`src/routes.js`):** Applied the `validateOwnership` middleware to the `GET /status/:orderId` route.
*   **Impact:** **This was the most critical fix.** It ensures users can only access their own payment data, patching a severe authorization flaw.

## ‚öôÔ∏è IV. Code Refactoring & Cleanup

### 1. **Simplified Authentication Middleware**
*   **Route Change (`src/routes.js`):** Removed the redundant `extractUserId` middleware from all authenticated routes.
*   **Controller Change (`src/controllers/paymentController.js`):** Updated all controller functions to get the user ID directly from `req.user`, which is populated by the primary `authenticate` middleware.
*   **Impact:** Streamlined the authentication flow, removed unnecessary code, and improved maintainability.

### 2. **Corrected Route Definitions (`src/routes.js`)**
*   **Change:** Corrected imported controller function names (e.g., `verifyWebhook` to `handleWebhook`) and middleware paths to match the actual file structure.
*   **Impact:** Fixed critical runtime errors that would have prevented the application from starting.
